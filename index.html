                        Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down.
                        And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell ya how I came to a city called Minneapolis.
                        In eastern Iowa born and raised in the middle of corn fields is where I spent most of my days...

                    <p class="bio">
                        Well that's as far I get before nothing rhymes, so here's the rest of the story:
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio">
                        I grew up in a town of less than 500 and graduated high school with 48 other students in 2012.
                        Through some turns of fate I ended up at the University of Minnesota on their Varsity Women's Rowing team.
                        These unexpected turns afforded me a full-scholarship and the time to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology with minors in Statistics and Sports Management.
                        As if I hadn't already been bless with opportunity, fate also had it so that I met my current boss in a marketing class during my last semester of college.
                        Meeting him lead to an internship with the Minnesota Vikings, wherein I became full-time.
                        Being in a more permanent I was then able to propose all of the benefits coding could bring to our day-to-day and, VOILA, here I am!

                    <p class="bio">
                        Outside of work and class I do/enjoy CrossFit (my newest adventure), calligraphy, reading, cycling and volunteering with the American Diabetes Association's Tour de Cure Ride/Run/Walk.
                        In fact, I'll be riding in the Tour de Cure's 100 mile race -
